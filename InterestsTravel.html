		<h4> Travel </h4>
		<p> Last year, my family and I went on the trip of a lifetime to Florida. We visited different amusement parks 
		like Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Busch Gardens.We jetted off in the second week of October from Dublin 
		and arrived in the early hours of a Wednesday in Orlando. We kicked the week of with a visit to the Epcot park in Walt
		Disney World. Throughout the rest of the week we visited Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom and of course rode the Tower
		of Terror in Holywood Studios (all of which are Disney Parks).We also visited Universal Studios during the evening time 
		to go to see the annual Halloween attraction, "Halloween Horror Nights". We ended the week with a visit to Busch Gardens
		where there was something for everyone from rollercoasters to up-close experiences with the animals onsite. </p>

		<h4> Sports </h4>
		<p> From the age of 9, I've played Gaelic footbal with my local club,***** *******. Now, I train twice a week and have a 
		match every weekend with the Junior Ladies and sometimes I play with the Senior Ladies team in the corner forward position.
		Over summer, when everyone is home from college, we have more sessions for strength and conditioning/fitness.
		
		I also play for the ladies soccer club, ********* ******, in the next town over and have been playing since I was 12.</p>
